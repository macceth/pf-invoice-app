## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with Redux, React-router
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Typescript ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

While my experience primarily used Vue.js as a JS framework, I want to extend my range of skills to learn React and Typescript and build this app as a practice. Tailwind is also new for me. So this project is like a new frontier of my experience.
