## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with Redux, React-router
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Typescript ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

While my experience mostly used Vue.js as a JS framework, I want to extend my skill so I learn React and Typescript and built this app as a practice. Tailwind is also new for me. So this project is like a new frontier of my experience.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
